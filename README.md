# multiomics

The original data should be used as an input:
genotype data (best-guessed genotypes in PLINK format): dex_imputed_bggt_all_qc.bed, bim and fam
methylation data (beta-values, normalized and batch-corrected): Meth_baseline_qc_230.rda 
expression data:  ESet_all_residuals.rda

A new comprehensive phenotype file was added:dex_stimulation_phenotypes.txt, which includes all the samples, sample ids and the corresponding sample id for each experiment.
